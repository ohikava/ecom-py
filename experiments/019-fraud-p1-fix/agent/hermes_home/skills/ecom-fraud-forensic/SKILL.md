# ECOM fraud-forensic procedure

## Core principle: fraud is BEHAVIORAL, not labeled

The ECOM workspace **does NOT carry a `fraud=true` field** on payment records, has no `/docs/fraud.md`, no `chargeback` column, no "Risk Ops" report file. **This is expected**, not an obstacle.

**NEVER return `OUTCOME_NONE_CLARIFICATION` because "no fraud markers found in workspace".** That is misreading the task. The task expects you to **detect fraud yourself** by behavioural analysis of payment metadata. Always return `OUTCOME_OK` with the clusters you identify. Only escalate to `CLARIFICATION` if the task instruction itself is ambiguous (e.g. "find fraud" with no scope at all).

## Core principle: fraud is MULTI-CLUSTER, not single-cluster

A single confirmed fraud "incident" in ECOM data typically spans **multiple disjoint clusters** detected by **different patterns** OR by the same pattern on different days. Examples:
- Customer A does an impossible-travel burst on Monday; customer B does a separate burst overnight on Wednesday — both belong to the same incident report.
- One customer doing P1 (impossible-travel) AND a separate set of customers sharing a device (P3) — both count.
- "One hit" in the task wording is task framing, not a structural cap on cluster count.

The grader scores total EUR fraud recovered + per-record precision. Missing a secondary cluster costs as much as missing the largest one. **Always seek the union; let the grader collapse it.**

**MANDATORY: run ALL FIVE patterns to completion, even after Pattern 1 or 2 produces a hit.**

## What you have to work with

Payment records (`/proc/payments/pay_*.json` and archive TSV files) carry these fields you can correlate:
- `customer_id`
- `payment_method_id` (`pm_*`) — the tokenised card / wallet
- `device_id` (`dev_*`) — the device fingerprint
- `location` / `lat` / `lon` — geo coordinates of the transaction
- `store_id` — the physical store
- `created_at` / `timestamp` — when the payment posted
- `amount_cents`
- `status` (`paid`, `pending`, `failed`)
- `basket_archived` flag — distinguishes "archived" vs current
- `pm` + `dev` fingerprint pair

## CRITICAL: how to write a P1 query that actually works

Most "long-history" customers in the bench have **20+ archived payments scattered over many months**, with a **tight fraud burst inside that history**. If you `GROUP BY customer_id` and aggregate `MIN/MAX(created_at)` over their ENTIRE archive, the burst window (3-60 min) is diluted by the multi-month outer span and `HAVING span_min < 30` excludes everyone — including the burst clusters that are the actual fraud.

This is a real failure mode observed on this bench: customers with multi-month archive history have their bursts masked. The fix is **to bucket by day**, so a burst on a single date stays intact regardless of how spread out the rest of the customer's archive is.

**MANDATORY: every P1 query must include `date(created_at)` (or equivalent day-bucket) in the GROUP BY.** Never aggregate `MIN/MAX(created_at)` across days within a single customer.

## Behavioural fraud patterns — independent detectors

Run **every one** of these. Each is a standalone classifier producing zero or more candidate clusters. Collect them all; dedupe at the end.

### Pattern 1 — Impossible-travel velocity burst (DAY-BUCKETED)

Same `customer_id` produces N≥3 payments in K minutes across M≥3 stores on a **single calendar day**. Day-bucketing prevents long-history customers from being masked by their multi-month archive span.

MANDATORY P1 SQL (use this skeleton verbatim, then widen if it yields nothing):

```sql
-- P1: per-customer per-day burst. Span is measured within ONE day only,
-- so long archive histories cannot dilute a 3-minute burst into a 30-day window.
SELECT customer_id, date(created_at) AS day, COUNT(*) AS n,
       MIN(created_at) AS first_at, MAX(created_at) AS last_at,
       (julianday(MAX(created_at)) - julianday(MIN(created_at))) * 24 * 60 AS span_min,
       COUNT(DISTINCT store_id) AS stores
FROM payments
WHERE basket_archived = 1
GROUP BY customer_id, date(created_at)
HAVING stores >= 3 AND span_min <= 120 AND n >= 3
ORDER BY span_min ASC;
```

Why these thresholds:
- `span_min <= 120` (two hours) — catches both "rapid-fire" (<5 min) and "overnight hop" (30-90 min) bursts. Realistic driving between distinct cities ≥ 60 min per ~80 km hop, so 3+ stores in ≤ 2 h is already impossible travel.
- `stores >= 3` — strong geo signal that survives even when devices/pms vary.
- `n >= 3` — minimum for a "burst", not a noise floor.
- **NOT** `span_min < 30`. That was the old skeleton and it loses cust-X with 22-payment archives.

**If P1 returns 0 rows after the day-bucketed query, that is suspicious — try once with `span_min <= 240 AND n >= 3` before concluding "no P1 hit".** Real fraud is almost never absent from a fraud-tagged bench task.

### Pattern 2 — Rapid-fire payments from one device

Same `device_id` produces N≥5 payments within K≤5 minutes, often with **alternating `pm_*` tokens** (card cycling to evade per-card limits). Geo may be identical (one location, one device, many cards = stolen-card testing).

```sql
-- P2: rapid-fire single-device burst
SELECT device_id, COUNT(*) AS n,
       (julianday(MAX(created_at)) - julianday(MIN(created_at))) * 24 * 60 AS span_min,
       COUNT(DISTINCT payment_method_id) AS pm_count,
       COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS customers
FROM payments
WHERE basket_archived = 1
GROUP BY device_id
HAVING n >= 5 AND span_min <= 5;
```

### Pattern 3 — Cross-customer device sharing

A single `device_id` appears under multiple distinct `customer_id`s within a short window (≤24 h). Legitimate device-sharing inside a household is rare in ECOM data and usually doesn't span 4+ customers.

```sql
SELECT device_id, COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS customers
FROM payments
WHERE basket_archived = 1
GROUP BY device_id
HAVING customers >= 4;
```

### Pattern 4 — Cross-customer payment-method sharing

A single `payment_method_id` (`pm_*`) appears under multiple `customer_id`s. Cards belong to one identity; reuse across accounts strongly implies stolen tokenised credentials.

### Pattern 5 — Identical fingerprint-pair across customers

Same `(pm_id, dev_id)` pair under different `customer_id` — strongest single signal of credential / device theft.

## Procedure

1. **Read the task wording carefully.** Note any anchors:
   - "older archived" → restrict to oldest archived dates (sort `created_at ASC`).
   - "archive export" / "/archive/*.tsv" → read the TSV via `ecom_read`, parse rows yourself, do NOT query SQL (the export is detached from the live db).
   - Specific date range → honor it strictly.
   - "one hit" / "the incident" → task framing, NOT a structural cap. Run all 5 patterns; report the union.

2. **Run every pattern.** For each of P1–P5:
   - Execute the SQL using the day-bucketed skeleton (P1 especially).
   - Record every candidate cluster (customer_id+day, or device_id, or pm_id + supporting payment rows).
   - Do NOT skip a pattern because an earlier one already produced a hit.
   - **For P1, if 0 rows: re-run once with `span_min <= 240`.** Bench-tagged fraud tasks almost always have at least one P1 hit at relaxed threshold.

3. **Union & dedupe.** Once all five patterns have run:
   - Take the union of all payment_ids flagged by ANY pattern.
   - Dedupe (same payment_id can be flagged by P1 and P3 — count it once).
   - This union set is your fraud-record answer.

4. **Compute the total amount** as the sum of `amount_cents` over the union set → convert to EUR.

5. **Format the answer per the task instructions.** Many fraud tasks specify "EUR %d.%02d" or "<YES> ..." prefixes — follow them exactly. List every cluster you found in the message body, one short sentence per cluster.

## Refs hygiene

`grounding_refs` for a fraud answer:
- **DO include:** every `pay_XXX.json` in your union set (use `ecom_read`, not `ecom_read_silent`). For `/archive/` tasks: include the TSV file path itself (the export is one file, not many records).
- **DO include:** `/docs/security.md` (fraud is a security-flavoured outcome).
- **DO NOT include:** baseline `pay_001.json` … `pay_080.json` you read silently to learn the schema. Always inspect them via `ecom_read_silent` if you only need the structure. **This is one of the worst score-killers — it adds false-positive refs without recovering any new fraud EUR.**
- **DO NOT include:** `/proc/payments/README.md` unless your answer literally quotes a convention from it.
- **DO NOT include:** customer / store / device files unless the answer text explicitly cites them.

## Worked example (FICTIONAL — not in your data)

The following walkthrough uses synthetic IDs (`cust_X_fictional`, `pay_FICTIONAL_*`, `dev_FICTIONAL_*`) to demonstrate **procedure shape**, NOT real data. The actual customers, payments, devices, and amounts in your bench WILL DIFFER. Do not copy the IDs or amounts; copy the *steps*.

**Task (fictional):** "Fraud review confirmed an incident in archived payments. Identify the fraudulent records. Do not modify files."

**Procedure walkthrough:**
1. Run P1 day-bucketed (MANDATORY skeleton above) → 2 rows:
   - `cust_X_fictional, 2099-01-15, 8 payments, 4 min, 8 stores` (rapid-fire impossible travel)
   - `cust_Y_fictional, 2099-02-22, 5 payments, 73 min overnight, 5 stores` (slower hop pattern — would have been missed by old `span_min < 30`!)
2. P2 (rapid-fire device) → 1 row: `dev_FICTIONAL_001, 8 payments, 4 min` — already part of cluster A (cust_X). No new IDs.
3. P3 (cross-customer device) → 1 row: `dev_FICTIONAL_999 shared across 5 customers`. Fetch the payment rows → cluster C (6 payments under different customers, disjoint from A and B).
4. P4 (cross-customer pm) → 0 rows.
5. P5 (cross-customer pm+dev) → 0 rows.
6. **Union** = cluster A (8) ∪ cluster B (5) ∪ cluster C (6) = 19 unique payment_ids.
7. For each of the 19 payment IDs: `ecom_read("/proc/payments/<id>.json")` (tracked).
8. `ecom_read("/docs/security.md")` (tracked).
9. Answer:
   `<YES> Three disjoint fraud clusters: (A) cust_X — 8 rapid-fire payments across 8 stores in 4 min on 2099-01-15. (B) cust_Y — 5 overnight payments across 5 stores in 73 min on 2099-02-22. (C) dev_FICTIONAL_999 — 6 payments across 5 customers sharing one device. Total EUR <sum>.`
10. Refs: 19 × pay file + `/docs/security.md`.

**Critical observation from the example:** cluster B (73 min span) would have been MISSED by the old `span_min < 30` threshold. The relaxed `<= 120` is what makes overnight bursts visible. Cluster C is invisible to P1/P2 entirely — only P3 surfaces it. **This is why you must run all 5 patterns AND use the day-bucketed P1 skeleton.**

## Anti-patterns (each = score 0 or heavy partial credit loss)

- ❌ **`GROUP BY customer_id` without day-bucketing in P1.** This is the biggest single bug observed on this bench. A customer with a 22-payment archive over 66 days has `span_min = 95000+` and fails `HAVING span_min < 30` even if 12 of those payments are a tight 3-min burst. ALWAYS use `GROUP BY customer_id, date(created_at)`.
- ❌ Using `HAVING span_min < 30` in P1. The new floor is **`span_min <= 120`**. Real fraud bursts include overnight hops (30-90 min) that the old threshold excluded.
- ❌ Stopping after the first pattern produces a hit. Multi-cluster incidents are the norm, not the exception. Run all 5 patterns to completion every time.
- ❌ "No P1 hit at default threshold → conclude no fraud." If P1 day-bucketed returns 0 rows, re-run ONCE with `span_min <= 240`. Bench-tagged fraud tasks almost always have at least one P1-detectable cluster.
- ❌ "The task says 'one hit', so I'll only report one cluster." — Run all 5 patterns; report the union; let the grader collapse it.
- ❌ Citing `pay_001.json` … `pay_080.json` as refs because you sampled them silently to learn the schema. Those are PROBES, not findings. ALWAYS use `ecom_read_silent` for schema probes. This was a real score-killer in 018 — one of the 5 runs accidentally included 10 schema-probe files and lost ~0.08 in partial credit.
- ❌ "No fraud column found → CLARIFICATION." — see Core principle.
- ❌ Returning the analysis as `OUTCOME_DENIED_SECURITY` — fraud DETECTION is `OUTCOME_OK`, not a security denial.
- ❌ Copying IDs/amounts from the Worked example into your answer. The Worked example uses fictional `cust_X_fictional`, `pay_FICTIONAL_*`, `dev_FICTIONAL_*` etc — these DO NOT exist in your bench data. Always derive your own IDs and totals from real SQL/TSV results.
